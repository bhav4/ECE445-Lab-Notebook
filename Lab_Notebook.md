# Lab Notebook ECE 445

**18th January 2023**

Today we brainstormed many ideas. Some that we talked about today were :
- Checking how smelly your shoes are
- Smart showerhead
- Trash Collection Idea

We ended up deciding to explore the trash collection idea more and @manavm2 made a post on the webboard to see what the trash collection idea. The follwing is the post that we ended up making for the same :

> Just an idea I was thinking about was that what if we had like a funnel kind of thing that basically moves around and even when people throw trash it always catches it by moving around and then stores the trash underground for future trash collection. This way making sure there is not mess around the trash can and then can be later picked up based off of sensors letting the garbagemen know that is full.

We recieved a bunch od feedback on the same and were feeling less confident about the idea.
