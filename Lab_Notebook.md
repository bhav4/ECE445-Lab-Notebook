**18th January 2023**

Today we brainstormed many ideas. Some that we talked about today were :
- Checking how smelly your shoes are
- Smart showerhead
- Trash Collection Idea

We ended up deciding to explore the trash collection idea more and Manav made a post on the webboard to see what the trash collection idea. The follwing is the post that we ended up making for the same :

> Just an idea I was thinking about was that what if we had like a funnel kind of thing that basically moves around and even when people throw trash it always catches it by moving around and then stores the trash underground for future trash collection. This way making sure there is not mess around the trash can and then can be later picked up based off of sensors letting the garbagemen know that is full.

We recieved a bunch of feedback on the same and were feeling less confident about the idea.

After more discussion from the last post we decided to explore the smart showerhead again. After more thinking we realized that the idea could be better if we created a device that can be attached to any showerhead and measure a bunchh of stuff. Bhavana then made the following post:

> My idea centers around water retention for use in showers. There would be a device that could fit onto any type of shower head you had installed in your bathroom, and it could monitor the amount of water let out every minute. This could be useful in states or countries that are experiencing major drought in order to monitor home's total usage. Another feature that could be added to this device could be to add a temperature feature that monitors the temperature of the water instead of arbitrary ideas such as hot and cold. This way people can use a temperature that does not upset their scalp when they are washing their hair.

We then got more comments on our post and the TA liked the idea. After some more back and forth we decided that we should take another route where the showerhead could keep track of profiles and basically help people who share a shower.

We were feeling a lot more confident about the idea and decided to continue down this route.
